    <h1>Education</h1><hr/>

    <h2> <i> I am majoring in Intelligent Mechatronics Engineering at Sejong University.</i> </h2>
    <p>Recently, I took a web programming course and have learned to create basic websites, which I find incredibly fun!</p>   
    <p> I am interested in artificial intelligence and am currently studying machine learning through an AI club called "Smarcle."</p>
    <p>Recently, I have been particularly fascinated by learning different machine learning models and improving their performance.</p>
    <p>lately, I have been studying ensemble models, especially stacking, and experimented with training on the MNIST dataset to improve accuracy, which was the most enjoyable experience for me recently.</p>
